1. Basic Git Configuration (can be made on 3 levels System/User/Project)
	git config --global user.name "Manjit"
	git config --global user.email "someone@nowhere.com"
	git config --list (this fetches details from the .gitconfig file present in user's home directory)
2. git help log (opens up the git manual page for log command)
3. git init (creates .git directory where all tracking data is captured)
4. git add . (add all changes in the current directory)
5. git commit -m "Initial commit" (commit the changes and start tracking the file)
6. View commit logs:
	git log
	git log -n 5 (will show the 5 most recent commits)
	git log --since=2019-01-01
	git log --until=2019-01-01
	git log --author="Manjit" (don't need to specify the full name)
	git log --grep="Init"
	git log --oneline
7. The three tree architecture:
	+------------------+
	|    repository    |
	+------------------+
                   |
		   | git commit file.txt
		   |
	+------------------+
	|  staging index   |
	+------------------+
		   |
		   | git add file.txt
		   |
	+------------------+
	|     working      |
	+------------------+
8. Hash Values (SHA-1 hash algo) used to label each one of the commits.
   It also ensures data integrity. You can't change the commit message or author or parent of the commit without changing it's SHA value.
9. HEAD - points to the tip of the current branch in repository.
	cat .git/HEAD
	cat .git/refs/heads/master
10. git status
11. git diff (shows changes by comparing the repository version with that prsent in working area)
12. git diff --staged (compares repository version with staging area not the working area)
13. git diff --cached (same as above)
14. git rm file_to_delete.txt (puts the changes in staging area automatically)
15. git mv first.txt primary.txt (puts the changes in staging area automatically)

Real Project
1. git diff --color-words
2. git commit -am "Edits support phone number throughout website" (only includes the files that are being tracked)
3. git show 84ee18d (shows the changes that are part of commit 84ee18d)
   git show 84ee18d --color-words
4. git diff 84ee18d..62fa03d47 or git diff 84ee18d..HEAD --color-words(compares two commits older..newer)
5. git checkout -- index.html (will replace the working stage version discarding any changes made there with the one present on the repository)
6. git reset HEAD tours/ (unstage the changes: bring the changes from staging area to working area)
7. git commit --amend -m "Reorder recommended items for the trip" (this will put the changes currently present in staging tree with latest commit)
8. git commit --amend -m "Reorder recommended items for outdoor trip" (if staging area is clean then this will simply modify the commit message of the latest commit)
9. git checkout HEAD^ -- explorers.html (will bring the file version pertaining to the mentioned commit hash in working area)
10. git revert 8863104 (reverses the changes made in the commit mentioned in command and logs a new commit)
11. git clean -n (shows which all untracked files will be removed)
    git clean -f (will actually remove untracked files)
12. git rm --cached db-config.txt (used in conjuecton to .gitignore when the file has been set to be tracked but now we decide to keep it in .gitignore file)
