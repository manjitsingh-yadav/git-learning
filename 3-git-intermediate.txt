1. Branch management: git push --force (force push to remote)
			    git fetch
			       +
			    git reset --hard origin/master (needs to be run by each of the collaborators post a forced push)
2. Identify Merged Branches: Branches whose tips are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified)
				     git branch --merged
				     git branch --no-merged
				     git branch -r --no-merged | --merged
				     git branch --merged HEAD | july_release | origin/july_release | b325a7c49
3. Delete local and remote branches: git branch -d new_feature (this will work if all the commits of new_feature have been merged with main branch)
						 git branch -D new_feature (this option is used when you want to delete the branch knowing that not all the commits have been merged with main branch)
						 git push origin :new_feature
						 git push --delete origin new_feature
						 git push -d origin new_feature
4. Prune stale branches: git fetch + git remote prune origin (--dry-run)
						OR
				 git fetch --prune | -p (fetch and prune at the same time)
						OR
				 git config --global fetch.prune true (now it will always prune before fetching)
5. Tags: Are named reference to a commit. Most often used to mark releases (v1.0, v1.1)
	   git tag issue136 4rdf564e (lightweight)
	   git tag -am "Start" v0.0 d55bc490 (annotated)
	
	   git tag | git tag --list | git tag -l | git tag -ln
	   git tag -l "v2*"
	
	   git show v1.1
	   git diff v1.0..v1.1

	   git tag --delete v1.1 | -d v1.1

	   git push does not transfer tags to remote. They must be explicitly transfered. git fetch automatically retrives shared tags.
	   git push origin v1.1 (pushes a single tag)
   	   git push origin --tags (pushes all tags to remote)
	   git fetch (fetches both commits and tags)
	   git fetch --tags (only fetches tags)

	   git push origin :v1.0
6. Interactive staging: git add --interactive | -i
7. Cherry picking: Conceptually similar to copy-paste
			 Apply changes from one or more existing commits
			 Each existing commit is recorded as a new commit on the current branch
			 Can result in conflicts which must be resolved
	   git cherry-pick d9148fr5 | git cherry-pick d9148fr5..5rf786yu
	   (use --edit, -e to edit the commit message)
	   git cherry-pick --continue
8. Create diff patches: git diff 85rtyg67 98iujk6u7 > for_review.diff
9. Apply diff patches: git checkout -b tester 85327e7a
			     git apply for_review.diff
10. Rebasing: Shifts commits in the current branch down to the tip of another commit of another branch
			     git rebase master (here current branch will get rebased to tip of master branch)
			     git rebase master new_feature (rebase new_feature to tip of master, if not checked out to the new_feature branch)
			     git merge-base master new_feature (return commit where topic branch diverges, here the commit on master branch from where topic branch diverges)
11. Rebasing onto the other branches: git rebase --onto master camping expenses
						  (moving it to the master branch, capming is the point where the branch we are rebasing diverged from i.e. expenses
						   expenses was checkedout from camping, camping was checkedout from master now we are rebasing expenses to the master through this command)
12. Undo a rebase: git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD or git rebase --onto 9291f0c88 master new_feature
